HomomorphicCryptoLib
====================

This project consists of a library to partially homomorphic encryption, developed in Java, with support for Android projects.

The implementation is based on cryptographic mechanisms of electronic voting systems, using an **asymmetric scheme partially homomorphic encryption**, it corresponds to a variation of the *ElGamal* scheme popularly known. In this scheme the homomorphism is given by the multiplication operation of encrypted values resulting in the sum values of the planes.
